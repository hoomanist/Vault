we have a maze that is an $N\times M$ matrix named $A$ and it's elements are either 0 or 1 indicating whether it's empty or it's blocked.
we want to find a path from some arbitrary starting point to an ending point.

### 1- Deep-First Search
we define a [[Stack]] to house all of our frontier elements in the grid(neighbors of our latest checked element) also we have a set named "explored" to be used in avoiding double checking. 
### 2- Breadth-first Search

### 3- A* Search
