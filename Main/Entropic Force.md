# Entropic Force

Imagine we have a strand of molecule(such as a polymer) connected by one side to a wall and is fixed in place while other side is allowed to move freely and the entire molecule is suspended in a gravity-free vacum that is in [[Thermal Equilibrium]]. there are few microstates in which the molecule strand is straight and much greater probability of it coiling up into itself. therefore the straight molecule has lesser [[entropy]] and by the [[second law of thermodynamics]] it will coil up into higher entropy state. this can be understood as if there exists a force which compresses the molecule strand into this more entropic state which proportional to the spatial derivative of entropy and also the temperature of the system.
$$ F = - \frac{dS}{dx}T $$
also the reason why there is less chance of our molecule strand to be orthogonal is how orthogonal molecule has higher energe and as the system is in thermal equilibrium we can address the probabilities through considering our system as a [[canonical ensamble]] and so probability P is proportional to exponential of negetive E.
### Derivation of above equation 

consider a rubber in thermal equilibrium which stretched and is resisting against being stretched. for it we can write:
$$ dE_{int} = dQ - dW $$
and differential of work can be replaced as following:

$$dE_{int} = dQ + F dx$$
as the rubber is in thermal equilibrium with itself we can assume that $dE_{int}$ is zero so we can reorder the equation.
$$\frac{dQ}{dx} = -F$$
and because $dQ = TdS$ we have:
$$F = -T\frac{dS}{dx}$$
